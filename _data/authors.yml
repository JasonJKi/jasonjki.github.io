  about:
        I'm a PhD candidate at CUNY- City College of New York in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. 
      
        My research is focused on understanding how the brain respond to the surrounding environment. It's understood that the sensory and other information is represented in the the brain by its networks of neurons and the information about the sensory stimulus is encoded in patterns of action potential and transmitted into and around the brain. 
        Our approach is to utilize hybrid multidimensional encoding-decoding model to extract features that maps the relationship between the sensory stimulus and neural activity.
        My goal is to implement deep energy based stochastic model in order to get a deeper understanding of stimulus-response relationship.
